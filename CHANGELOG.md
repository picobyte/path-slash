# [0.1.2 (v0.1.2)](https://github.com/rhysd/path-slash/releases/tag/v0.1.2) - 16 Jun 2020

- **Fix:** Root path separator was doubled when the path contains Windows driver letter. For example, when `C:/foo` was given, `to_slash` converted it to `C:\\foo`. In this version it converts it to `C:\foo` correctly.
- **Improve:** Remove a redundant allocation at calling `to_slash()` method.
